# tic-tac-toe-game-using-DFS
Hi! This is a Jupyter Notebook where the player (client) can play a Tic Tac Toe game against an AI. The AI uses depth-first search (DFS) to select the best possible move at each turn. I developed this program for my Artificial Intelligence Lab course at university. I'm confident that the player cannot win this gameâ€”in the best case, it will end in a draw!
